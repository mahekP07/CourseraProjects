To open the interactive Dash Visualization : 

1) Open the working directory and locate the file.
2) Type python along with the filename 
	(since I'm using VSC I have written: python AustralianWildfires.py)
3) Once Dash is running it would prompt with the port number (e.g Dash is running on http://000.0.0.0:0000/)
4) Click on the server link to view and play around the graph.
